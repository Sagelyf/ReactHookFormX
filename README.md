Security Scan Tool for React Hook Form

This project provides an automated security scanning tool for the react-hook-form package and its dependencies. Using a combination of ESLint, npm audit, and Snyk, the tool ensures that your code and libraries are free from common security vulnerabilities.

‚ú® Key Features

	‚Ä¢	Automated Security Setup: Ensures essential security tools are installed and configured.
	‚Ä¢	Security Scans:
	‚Ä¢	ESLint with security plugin.
	‚Ä¢	npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Snyk scan for deep analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Temporary Project Clone: Clones react-hook-form to perform deep security audits.
	‚Ä¢	Detailed Security Reports: JSON-based reports for easy integration with CI/CD systems.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

	‚Ä¢	Node.js (version 14.x or above)
	‚Ä¢	npm or yarn package manager
	‚Ä¢	Snyk CLI (if not already installed, the script will install it automatically)

Installation

	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/security-scan-tool.git
cd security-scan-tool


	2.	Make the script executable:

chmod +x security-scan.js


	3.	Run the security scan:

./security-scan.js



Configuration

By default, the ESLint configuration will extend the recommended security rules:

{
  "plugins": ["security"],
  "extends": ["plugin:security/recommended"]
}

You can modify .eslintrc.json to fit your specific project needs.

üìä Reports

After running the script, you will get three security reports:

	‚Ä¢	ESLint Report: Located in eslint-report.json, details code-level security issues.
	‚Ä¢	npm Audit Report: Located in audit-report.json, shows dependency vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Snyk Report: Located in snyk-report.json, provides a deep security scan of dependencies.
