# ReactHookFormX Security Scan Tool üöÄ

This project provides an automated security scan tool for the react-hook-form library used in the ReactHookFormX project. It integrates key security analysis tools like ESLint, npm audit, and Snyk to ensure that the code and dependencies used in the ReactHookFormX are free from known security vulnerabilities and potential threats.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This security scan tool operates in a structured manner to automate the identification of security risks:

 1. Dependency Management:
 	- It checks if react-hook-form is installed. If not, it installs it automatically
	- It ensures the necessary security tools are available, such as ESLint, eslint-plugin-security, and Snyk.
2.	Configuration Setup:
	- An ESLint configuration is generated with a security plugin enabled to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase.
3. Cloning the Source Code:
	- The tool clones the official react-hook-form repository into a temporary directory to perform an in-depth scan of the source code.
4.	Security Scanning:
	- ESLint checks the cloned source code for security issues, such as unsafe coding practices.
	- pm audit examines project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
	- Snyk performs an advanced security scan, identifying issues in both direct and indirect dependencies.
5.	Reports Generation:
	‚Ä¢ Outputs results from ESLint, npm audit, and Snyk in JSON format for easy integration into CI/CD systems or manual review.
6.	Optional Cleanup:
	‚Ä¢ After the scan is completed, the temporary directory can be automatically removed to clean up the working environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Automated Dependency Installation: Ensures that react-hook-form and security 		tools are installed as needed.
- Security Scans:
	- ESLint: 
	Analyzes source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
	- npm audit: 
	Identifies vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
	- Snyk: 
	Performs an in-depth security check for both direct and transitive dependencies.
- Security Reports: 
	Generates JSON-based reports for easy integration with automation systems or manual analysis.
	- Customizable ESLint Config: Auto-generates .eslintrc.json with security-focused linting rules.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before running the security scan, ensure the following are installed on your system:

	‚Ä¢	Node.js (v14.x or later)
	‚Ä¢	npm or yarn
	‚Ä¢	Snyk CLI (will be installed automatically if not present)

Installation

	1.	Clone the ReactHookFormX Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sagelyf/ReactHookFormX.git
cd ReactHookFormX


	2.	Make the Security Scan Script Executable:

```
chmod +x security-scan.js
```
---
	3. Run the Security Scan:
---

```
./security-scan.js
```
---
Configuration

By default, the tool creates an ESLint configuration with security best practices enabled:

---
```
{
  "plugins": ["security"],
  "extends": ["plugin:security/recommended"]
}
```
---

You can modify this .eslintrc.json file to meet your specific project requirements.

### üìä Reports

Upon completion of the scan, you will find three reports:

	‚Ä¢	eslint-report.json: Contains results of the ESLint security scan.
	‚Ä¢	audit-report.json: Provides the results from npm audit, detailing vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	snyk-report.json: The Snyk scan report, identifying vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies.
